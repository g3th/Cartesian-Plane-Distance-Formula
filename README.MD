# Calculate Missing X - Cartesian Plane Distance Formula
## Given points (x,0) calculate equidistance from (x2, y2) and (x3, y3).

Using the Cartesian Plane Distance Formula, allow the user to enter co-ordinates to calculate the value of missing x.

If points (x,0) are equidistant from (x2, y2), entered by user input, and (x3, y3), also entered by user, calculate the value of the missing x co-ordinate.

If the value returns "Infinity" the program will inform the user.
